# Query Builder API

This project focusses on the query builder API.
It will build upon the [OpenAPI specification](http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3 "http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3") as a reference for building the catalogue APIs.

## Helpful Tools

- The Swagger Software (https://swagger.io) offers several free tools that help build APIs that are compliant with the OpenAPI specification:

  - Swagger Editor (https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/) can be used to build valid API calls.
  - Swagger Inspector (https://inspector.swagger.io/builder) is a browser extension that can be used to validate API calls.
  
- OpenAPI Examples can be found here https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/master/examples.

## Specification

The specification (https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/query_builder_api/edit/master/specification.yaml) is a first proposal oriented towards the Beacon-v1 API specification (https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification/blob/master/beacon.md) which is again oriented towards the OpenAPI specifictaion.
