# Query Builder API

This project focusses on the query builder API. 
It will build upon the OpenAPI (https://www.openapis.org/) specification as a reference for building the catalogue APIs.

## Helpful Tools

- The Swagger Software (https://swagger.io) offers several free tools that help build APIs that are compliant with the OpenAPI specification:

  - Swagger Editor (https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/) can be used to build valid API calls.
  - Swagger Inspector (https://inspector.swagger.io/builder) is a browser extension that can be used to validate API calls.
